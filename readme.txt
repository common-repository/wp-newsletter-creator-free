== Description ==

Every business should keep in contact with its existing client base. These are customers who have already bought from you and therefore trust you/your product. They are also the most likely group to buy from you again, so it is important to maintain contact with them whenever you have something new to tell them about, and in which they may be interested. The best way to do this is through the use of a regular newsletter. This may sound like a lot of work. In fact it used to be, but not anymore…

Why you should use an email marketing service provider to send out your newsletter If you use email to send newsletters to a large number of contacts, you might encounter problems. Almost all hosting providers do not allow you to send out more than 500 e-mails at one time, some service providers have even lower limits. If you exceed the limit, your email will be flagged from the receiver’s servers as SPAM. It does not matter if, in fact, your email is not SPAM. Because of the high volume of email coming from your server, the problem will automatically present itself. Your server will be blacklisted, which means that your server will be evermore flagged as a SPAM sending server! For this reason, if you are sending high volumes of emails the best choice, in order to avoid unpleasant consequences, is to use an email marketing service provider such as MailChimp, AWeber, CleverReach and the like.
